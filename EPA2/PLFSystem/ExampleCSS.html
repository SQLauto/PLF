                    Program (NTIP), as well as learning acquired throughout each individual’s teaching career.

                    That depends on whether a teacher is new or experienced. A new teacher must be appraised at
                    least twice during the first 12 months of teaching. There will be additional appraisals if the new
                    teacher receives a performance rating that is either Development Needed or Unsatisfactory. An
                    experienced teacher is appraised once every five years, and will receive additional appraisals if
                    the performance rating is Unsatisfactory, of if concerns related to the teacher’s performance
                    cause the principal to require one..

                    For an experienced teacher who is new to a board, the first year of employment is an appraisal
                    year. Provided that the teacher obtains a Satisfactory rating, the five-year performance appraisal
                    cycle begins when the teacher completes that year..
